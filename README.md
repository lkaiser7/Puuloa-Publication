Puʻuloa, the broader region that includes Pearl Harbor and its estuary, was once renowned for its abundance, featuring numerous loko iʻa (fishponds), calm waters, and abundant streams. The area was sustained by integrated agriculture and aquaculture systems, guided by Native Hawaiian stewardship practices. It is still home to several species of endangered and endemic birds today (Hawaiʻi DLNR-DOFAW, n.d.). The introduction of commercial agriculture and militarization in the 1800s led to rapid land use changes, resulting in a legacy of pollution in the area. In addition, today, many of the 300,000 Puʻuloa residents meet several socioeconomic vulnerability criteria, increasing risks associated with contaminant exposure.
