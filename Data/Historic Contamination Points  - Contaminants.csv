The extraction and processing of basalt materials release potentially hazardous PM, reducing air quality. Health implications with exposure may include increased risk of lung disease and cancers upon inhalation of PM with respiratory toxicities. Another possible effect of exposure is silicosis amongst workers with high crystalline silica content in materials."," A full environmental assessment of respective environmental and human health impacts will be performed upon closure of the property in 2032. Grace Pacific attempts to reduce airborne pollution by watering their quarry activities and maintaining a 300-acre buffer zone around the property. At present, public health threats primarily affect workers at the facility who may be exposed to airborne contaminants via inhalation.
